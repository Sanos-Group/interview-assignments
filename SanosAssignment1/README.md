# Sanos Assignment 1

## Task

You are given a bare-bone react-native app. It contains only one Api-Service (_MediaService_) to fetch
metadata for audio files, audio files, and images.
Please create screens and logic to list the metadata from the _MediaService_ and allow users
to play an audio file of their choice as well as look at the file's detailed metadata.

After your changes the app should:
- Visually list metadata of the files
- show details for the files
- play the audio for a selected file and resume from the last position upon App re-opening
- cache the fetched data
- work offline with cached data

Additionally, the app should fulfil the following requirements:
- it must be functional and robust
- Usability
- Code quality
- it must work on both iOS and Android
